## Introduction

In my testing I developed a comprehensive testing plan to make sure that the site was functioning correctly. I used predominantly manual testing, 
I did investigate the option of writing bespoke automated tests and ran a few trial tests at the end of the development process as part of my own 
learning and personal development, but due to the way I had written the JavaScript and the resulting complexity of the automated testing that 
I would need to write, I felt that it was not necessary for this application as it was a fairly simple app that would be better served by in-depth 
manual testing which I have detailed below.

My manual testing involved going through the game and manually checking all elements behaved as expected and making sure that the JavaScript 
was producing the correct results based on the user selections. I have also included details of automated testing/validation that I undertook 
which included validation for HTML & CSS and checking the site for accessibilty and performance. The site was tested throughout the process, 
both in the development and deployed version of the sites. All the test results detailed below are based on the 
[deployed site](https://christiangoran.github.io/child-personality-quiz/). 

## Automated Checks and Validation

### HTML Validation

I ran the code for all the pages through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/).

#### **Errors**

There were now errors found.


#### **HTML Validation Post-Fix**

None required.

### CSS Validation

I ran the CSS code through the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input). 

#### **Errors**
<details><summary>CSS Validation Initial Results</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/christiangoran/child-personality-quiz/blob/main/assets/wireframes/wc3-css-validation.png">
</details>

There were 3 errors:

Error 1: #restart-button | Value Error : height Unknown dimension 5wv 
* Fix: remove height value (not doing anything)

Error 2-3: 
200 	#categories p 	Value Error : line-height auto is not a line-height value : auto
309 	#categories p 	Value Error : line-height auto is not a line-height value : auto 
* Fix: remove height value (not doing anything)

### JavaScript Validation

I ran the JavaScript code through [JSHint](https://jshint.com/). 

There were no errors and at first I got over 70 warnings. After a short research I wound that if adding "/*jshint esversion: 6 */" to the top
of the console the warnings were reduced to 4 warnings, 1 undefined variable, 3 unused variables.

<details><summary>Warning</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/christiangoran/child-personality-quiz/blob/main/assets/wireframes/jshint.png">
</details>

* Fix: remove or add semi-colons as appropriate

Warning: "The body of a for in should be wrapped in an if statement to filter unwanted properties from the prototype."

* Fix: I did extensive investigation about this warnings, it seems to typically occurs when you loop through an object using a 
for...in loop without checking whether the object has its own property or the inherited property from its prototype.

    //To fix this issue, I used the hasOwnProperty method to check whether the property belongs to the object or its prototype.
    (https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-the-hasownproperty-method-in-javascript)
    
    ```
    function findWinner(result) {
    let maxPercentage = 0;
    let winningKey;
    for (let key in result) {
        if (result.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      if (result[key] > maxPercentage) { // Learned more about finding largest number in an array here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/three-ways-to-return-largest-numbers-in-arrays-in-javascript-5d977baa80a1/ //
        maxPercentage = result[key];
        winningKey = key;
      }
    }
   }
   ```
 Warning: 'Object spread property' is only available in ES9
 
 * I added "/*jshint esversion: 9 */" to the top of the console and the warning disappeared.
 
 <details><summary>One ndefined Variable</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/christiangoran/child-personality-quiz/blob/main/assets/wireframes/jshint-undefined-variable.png">
</details>
   
One Undefined variable (buildPie) is used in another js-file called piechart.js.


<details><summary>Warning 5: Undeclared/Unused Variables</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/christiangoran/child-personality-quiz/blob/main/assets/wireframes/jshint-unused-variables.png">
</details>

* Fix: remove undeclared variables where appropriate. One of these warnings was due to the function being called in index.html to handle the 
form submission for the username. This was shown to us as good practice for handling form submission by Code Institute so I left it as it 
was (see code snippet below).

    ```
    // In index.html
    <form id="start-form" method="POST" onsubmit="startGame(event)">

    // in quiz.js
    function startGame(event)
    ```


#### **JavaScript Validation Post-Fix**

### Accessibility

I ran the site through the [Wave Web Accessibility Evaulation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). 

#### **Accessibility Errors**

There were no errors. However I had 6 warnings.

<details><summary>Accessibility warnings</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/christiangoran/child-personality-quiz/blob/main/assets/wireframes/accessibility-warnings.png">
</details>

* Fix: change <p> to <h3>

There were no errors or warnings on 404.html.

#### **Wave Web Accessibility Results Post-Fix **

### Performance

I ran the site through Google Chrome Dev Tools' Lighthouse to check on its performance.

#### **Original Results**
<details><summary>Main Page</summary>
<img src="https://github.com/christiangoran/child-personality-quiz/blob/main/assets/wireframes/lighthouse-results.png">
</details>

There were 2 issues of concern: 

1. The performance score was somewhat lower because of the piechart.js file with the pieChart function that seem to slow the process down. However the 
score is still on an acceptable level.

2. The SEO score was somewhat lower as well due to missing meta text i the HTML. The solution for this was to define keywords and a description of the 
web site.

## Manual Testing
### Testing User Stories

I tested the site based on my user stories:

| No. | User Goal | How is it achieved? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Learning more about myself and my childhood personality | The quiz is a fun, online game which gave me a resulting personality after answering the questions |
| 2 | Having fun doing a short quiz | I am of course bias, as well as the fact that I've taken the quiz at least a hundred times while testing the site. Nonetheless I had great fun making the quiz as well as playing it |
| 3 | Having a nice walk down memory lane | When seeing the different answers to each question I definitely take a walk down memory lane |
| 4 | I want to access the quiz on any device | The quiz has been designed to be fully responsive across desktop, tablet and mobile and extensively tested on each.|
| 5 | I want to navigate the site easily | The site has a linear navigation where you follow the quiz through and minimal clicks are required to submit answers. At the end there is a button to take you back to the beginning of the quiz.|
